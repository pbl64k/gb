I wrote this wonky little message board ca. 2000 at a friend's request.
It went live and did its wonky little thing for a couple of years
afterwards, maybe more. It certainly brought a few good people together
but the thought of HOW it was made gives me shivers now.

Let it remain here a sobering testament of how much of an idiot I was ten
years back. (And I can only hope that in ten more years I shall perceive
the current me quite as much of an idiot.)
